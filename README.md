# workdayscheduler
## User Story

```
As a bus employee, I need a scheduler to log all of my activities in a work day, that  is color coded showing when things should be complete.
```

##Website Functionality

```
GIVEN I am on the application
WHEN I enter  a event 
THEN It stays until it is  removed
WHEN When the  time for an event has passed
THEN That event will turn red
WHEN The time for the event lines up with the current time
THEN The event will be grey

```
The following screenshot demonstrates the application functionality : assets/workdayscheduler.png

## Obstacles faced during development
```
API is not pulling data causing application to be static. 
```
## Instructions for future development
```
Would like  to return to this assignment and complete with a better knowledge of API's.
