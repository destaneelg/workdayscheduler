# workdayscheduler
## User Story

```
As a busy employee, I need a scheduler to log all of my activities in a work day, that is color coded showing when things should be complete.
```

##Website Functionality

```
GIVEN I am on the application
WHEN the time for an event has passed
THEN That event will turn red
WHEN The time for the event lines up with the current time
THEN The event will be grey. 
WHEN an event is in the future
THEN the timeblock will appear green

```
The following screenshot demonstrates the application functionality : workday.png

## Obstacles faced during development
```
I had issues keeping the text area white with the color changing time blocks, and pulling from local storage.
```
## Instructions for future development
```
I would like to redo this with Scheduler.js to see what functionality would change and get the local storage component working.
